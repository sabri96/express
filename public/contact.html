      At the 2006 All-Star Game, James led the East to victory with 29 points
      and was named the NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player.[37] Behind final
      season averages of 31.4 points, 7 rebounds, and 6.6 assists per game,[38]
      he also finished second in overall NBA Most Valuable Player Award voting
      to Steve Nash.[39] Under James's leadership, the Cavaliers qualified for
      the playoffs for the first time since 1998.[40] In his postseason debut,
      James recorded a triple-double in a winning effort versus the Washington
      Wizards.[41] In Game 3 of the series, he made the first game-winning shot
      of his career, making another in Game 5.[42] Cleveland would go on to
      defeat the Wizards before being ousted by the Detroit Pistons in the
      second round.[43]In 2006â€“07, James's averages declined to 27.3 points, 6.7
      rebounds, 6 assists, and 1.6 steals per game.[9] Some analysts attributed
      the fall to a regression in his passing skills and shot selection, which
      stemmed from a lack of effort and focus [44] The Cavaliers finished the
      season with 50 wins for the second consecutive year and entered the
      playoffs as the East's second seed.
